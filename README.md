# Resume

Follow through of Peter Shirley book series [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

This repo is intended as a practice over Ray Tracing concepts and practical implementation.

TODO: Expand readme with important definitions and implementation details.

Defocus Blur:
Side effect propesed under the same series. I decided to attach it onto a separeted branch as seems unrelated to default behavior of a ray tracer.
It uses the thin lens approximation.

TODO: Resolve if should merge in main.
