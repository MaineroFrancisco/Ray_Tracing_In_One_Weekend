# Resume

Follow through of Peter Shirley book series:
- [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
- [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)
- [_Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html)

This repo is intended as a practice over Ray Tracing concepts and practical implementation.

# TODO:
- [ ] Play with colors: Spectral Ray Tracing.
- [ ] Implement other primitives beside quads.
- [ ] General rotations? too complex? Transforming rays instead of objects
- [ ] Photon mapping (fancy)
