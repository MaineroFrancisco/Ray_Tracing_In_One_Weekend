# Resume

Follow through of Peter Shirley book series [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview).

This repo is intended as a practice over Ray Tracing concepts and practical implementation.

TODO: Expand readme with important definitions and implementation details.

Side effect propesed under the same series. I decided to attach it onto a separeted branch as seems unrelated to default behavior of a ray tracer.

TODO: Resolve if should merge in main.
